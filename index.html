          <h1>The Blog Begins</h1>
          <h3>August 21, 2018</h3>

          <p>I'm as shy of words as I am of cameras. They are both unflattering and it's glaringly obvious how pained I am to seem at ease, cool, smart, or even just pretty alright. Instead you can see the crazy swirling around behind shifty eyes. At least that's what I see, so yeah, I keep away from the pointy side of the lens and a wagging tongue.</p>

          <p>And here I go starting a blog. Why? Because I'm finally taking action and choosing a path, a path I've considered before in less concrete ways, and could never get much traction in. I'm going to do my damnedest to become a professional web developer.</p>

          <p>The decision has been forced due to issues that make physical labor no longer sustainable for me. I'll be in pain for the rest of my life regardless of my profession, but there's no reason for me to aggravate the problem with the work I do. I need to save my physical efforts for healthy things like working out and training in martial arts - things that make me feel good despite the pain.</p>

          <p>So where am I on this path? To me it seems like maybe a mile in at this point. And honestly I've covered this mile a couple of times over the years, but never quite the same way and the field has changed a lot over the years I've watched it. I'm relearning HTML/CSS right now. I've had some experience with JavaScript and even less with Ruby before, but I'm concentrating on the fundamentals and trying to get that really fluid.</p>

          <p>I'm using the <a href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/intro-to-programming-online">Epicodus curriculum</a> and Colt Steele's "The Web Developer Bootcamp" course on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp">Udemy</a>. I blew through the first two weeks of the Epicodus material in about ten hours. Then I hit the assignment which is meant to teach Git branching and merging, as well as reinforce the basic HTML/CSS the course has covered to that point. The assignment was to create a multi-page website with at least two different styles/themes (hello, branching) for a "client" who operates a resort. When the client chose one of the versions, we're supposed to merge the chosen branch into the master.</p>

          <p>I was kind of stumped by the creative side of the assignment. I know enough to be a danger to myself and a website full of barely styled lists and random photos scattered throughout just didn't appeal to me. I wanted to make something at least marginally slicker than that. The problem is that besides needing to refresh on the material I'd learned previously, I have a kind of creative block on web design. There are so many ways a site can be layed out! What do I choose? How does my choice affect how I structure the HTML? How do I write HTML that CSS can style any way I want without editing it to work for the new styles? And how do I choose colors that aren't drab or garish, that have some kind of relationship to the project itself? Where do I get all these photos without spending hours just copying and pasting urls and file names? Aaaagggghhh!</p>

          <p>OK. Calm down, kid. How to tackle this reasonably? Through Mr. Steele's bootcamp I knew that Bootstrap Grid was a thing and made lay out way way more simple than it was when I first encountered this stuff in 2000. Then I found out that CSS has a native grid (presumably this is what Bootstrap exploits and embellishes, but I don't know that for a fact yet). I decided to first learn layout by building a photo gallery project using nothing but the old CSS float methods; then I recreated the same thing using CSS grids; next I'll tackle Bootstrap grid. But I wound up getting antsy about the resort project, so I ended up building it using vanilla CSS. (Is that a thing? Sometimes it's better to speculate - why let Google ruin everything with "facts?") Anyway, here we are almost two weeks later and I've nearly got the basic resort website done. From there I can start branching and seeing what I can do to make variations with what I've learned so far.</p>

          <p>I feel a bit ashamed that it's taken me this long to get this far with the resort project, but I did make some deep detours, learned a ton, and made it relevant to the assignment at a level way above what the assignment was really looking for in terms of HTML/CSS. I've a got a better toolbox and a better understanding of how to use those tools. There is still a lot of refinement to be done, of course, but I've definitely done something.</p>

          <p>From what I've been reading about the process of becoming a web developer, I'm going to have to bare myself a bit and push the things I've done so far to Github, even though they're silly, simple, and nothing more than me futzing around trying to see how some things worked (or didn't). I guess I'll lay it all out there and see what happens. At least it's the truth and might give someone a laugh.</p>

          <h1>Clunk, Clank, Thud</h1>
          <h3>August 22, 2018</h3>

          <p>Today I finished the first version of the resort website project. Next up is branching it and working on a new version. I did make a gh-pages branch, but I couldn't get Git to push it via the terminal. I ended up creating a branch on Github. The whole push thing has proven to be fuzzy for me. I can't tell yet where it's getting the user name or why it seems to change on me. Sometimes it's "sb" which I set for one of the early projects. For this blog it seems to be "-u" (???) which I need to look up. I'll hazard a guess that it means something along the lines of "get the current username." I'm going to go back to the beginning of the Epicodus course and review. I'm having the same trouble branching and getting this blog on gh-pages. I will solve this.</p>

          <h1>Git It!</h1>
          <h3>August 23, 2018</h3>

          <p>I'm still working on making sure that I understand Git and the process for creating a local repository, a remote repository, branching, merging, and gh-pages. I failed at this with my original blog repository and it all got too confused, so I have deleted that repository on Github and started a new local repository called codeBlog. It's exactly the same; only the name has changed.</p>

          <p>So here are the steps as I understand them (I'm using the terminal here, just in case you don't already know that, and I'm only showing the basic form of the commands for brevity and because this is really for my own understanding at this point.):
            <ol>
              <li><strong>[$ mkdir and $ touch]</strong>: create a local directory and any files you want in it;</li>
              <li><strong>[$ cd]</strong>: navigate into the directory;</li>
              <li><strong>[$ git init]</strong>: initialize the repository;</li>
              <li><strong>[$ git status]</strong>: optional command to verify that Git is tracking the repository and check on the state of the repository;</li>
              <li><strong>[$ git add]</strong>: stage one or more files or even the entire repository for committing;</li>
              <li><strong>[$ git status]</strong>: verify what has been staged for committing;</li>
              <li><strong>[$ git commit]</strong>: commit the current state of the repository. The message appended to this commit needs to be in present tense and complete the sentence, "This commit will . . .";</li>

              <li><strong>[$ git log]</strong>: to see the Git history and verify that this commit went as planned;</li>
              <p>Go to Github and create a remote repository with the exact same name as the local repository. Use the URL Github gives you in the next step.</p>
              <li><strong>[$ git remote add (nickname or initals) (Github URL to the remote repository)]</strong>: direct Git to the Github repository to which to push the local repository;</li>
              <li><strong>[$ git remote -v]: </strong>: verify that this worked as planned;</li>
              <li><strong>[$ git push (nickname or initals) master]: </strong>: push the local repository to the remote (Github) repository;</li>
              <li><strong>[$ git branch (branch name)]: </strong>: create a branch repository from the master repository;</li>
              <li><strong>[$ git checkout (branch name)]: </strong>: "navigate" to the branch - any changes will be made to the branch leaving the master as it is;</li>
              <li><strong>[$ git push (nickname or initals) (branch name)]: </strong>: push this branch of the local repository to its "twin" remote (Github) repository;</li>

            </ol>
          </p>

          <p> This is as far as I have gotten, and it's a really good thing I listed out the step like this. To do this I combed back through the Epicodus curriculum to make sure I had the steps and commands right. I realized in the process that past a certain point I was following steps that were meant for dealing with a repository that has been cloned from Github. The basics are the same, but "origin" is used instead of a nickname or initals because "origin" is the nickname Git automatically gives to cloned repositories.</p>

          <p>I'll follow these steps for codeBlog and see how it pans out . . .</p>

          <p>And . . . it works! Well of course it does, if you do it right. That was a really good idea, listing out these steps: codeBlog is now hosted <a href="https://skillitzimberg.github.io/codeBlog/">here</a>.</p>

          <p>Next on my coding plate is to look into the semantic HTML elements and refactor some previous work to see how it is affected and what kinds of changes I'll need to make to the CSS. It seems like it would be easier in some ways. It could potentially make selecting much more specific and cut down some on classes and ID's.</p>

          <h1>Epicodus Journal Post One</h1>
          <h3>August 25, 2018</h3>

          <p><span>Why did you make the decision to enroll in a coding bootcamp? What are you aiming to achieve by completing 27 weeks of technical training?</span></p>
          <p>I got a job out of college in which one of my responsibilities was maintaining the website. I had never encountered HTML and CSS before. I learned how to do it by using "view source," CSSZengarden, and dissecting the code in order to see how it worked. I literally printed many pages of html and made diagrams to learn it. I gained some fluency and eventually redesigned the website from scratch. But between working, playing music, and relationships I could never devote myself to it. In late 2014 I enrolled in courses at Portland Community College to pursue a career in IT. One of the courses I took was an introduction to programming that used JavaScript. I really liked it and seemed to have an aptitude for it. I could easily spend 8 to 10 hours straight working on it. It absorbed me. Unfortunately, my relationship dissolved (not because of coding) and I had to make changes that did not allow me the time for school. Due to lifelong physical challenges, I've finally gotten to a place where I cannot sustain physical labor anymore and I am not willing to just take on any dead-end desk job. I need to take the plunge, risk it all. I've got nothing to lose and everything to gain.</p>

          <p><span>Do you already have specific goals for yourself in mind? If not, can you think of any now?</span></p>

          <p>My goal is to become a freelance web/app developer. I have that as my five year goal, but will do whatever I can to make it happen sooner. But honestly, just making a living coding, even at the financial level I have been working in warehouses and factories would be a major success. Ideally I'd like to work for small to medium size companies as I really appreciate that scale of business. There's something particulary intriguing to me about that level. Probably because I've tended to work for that size company and like how everyone knows everyone, processes are more fluid, and work is an "all hands on deck" affair - everyone can or does do everything, there are no real specialists.</p>

          <h1>Constipation</h1>
          <h3>August 27, 2018</h3>

          <p>I'm really having trouble with this resort website assignment. Not so much in just putting together a webpage, but in maybe trying to make it too complicated? Or just over thinking it? I don't know why. I know what kind of websites I would like to learn how to mimic just to be able to do it, but there's no need to do that with this assignment. On top of that mind game, I don't know where to start with images. They are unruly things. I'm not sure how to get them to the size I want without stretching out of proportion or only showing the top portion of them. There's got to be some set of tricks that tutorials just don't cover. Or I'm again over thinking what the tutorials are showing and missing some simple combination of attributes that would solve the issues I'm creating.</p>

          <p>I just need to make five webpages, put some photos and colors in them, then change the layout and color scheme a couple of times, but I can't seem to get past the idea of doing something grand. Really unhelpful and it's totally holding me back.</p>

          <p>OK. So the solution is to do what I said in the previous paragraph. Just let it be simple, even dumb. Just get it done. Done is better than stuck, even if the product isn't what you'd hoped for or tried to accomplish. Done is a better starting place.</p>

          <p>On a positive note, I am beginning to use semantic elements and they really do seem to make the html easier to read and selecting in css is far easier. Also, css grid makes doing wireframes pretty easy. So I have made progress there. I just have to get over this mental block on "creativity."</p>

          <h1>Sunset</h1>
          <h3>August 29, 2018</h3>

          <p>My life is about to change very dramatically. The if's are becoming when's and how's. But enough of that. We'll all be sick of hearing about it before long, so why start commenting on it now?</p>

          <p>It is 8:13PM, sunset in Portland, Oregon. I feel like I've had a bit of a success with coding today. Well, maybe over the last two days. I now have two branches of the resort project, master and sunset. Each is a complete, though very simple, website. I only changed one HTML element between them (an H1 to an H2) in the sunset branch. They look very different. Sunset is more along the lines of what I've been trying to accomplish and I created it by changing the CSS almost entirely without looking at the HTML. Past a certain pooint of course I checked in on the HTML and looked at it in the browser, but only once I knew in my mind pretty much how it was going to look. And I was pretty close to right. That felt like a victory.</p>

          <p>I stumbled across a developer named <a href="https://neilonsoftware.com/">Neil Green</a> today. He has a very interesting take on coding. It's more about philosophy and personality types in the world of working developers. As a person who has a fairly negative view of himself, I looked at his desciption of a developer type called The Incompetent. This is my worst case scenario. I fear I could very well be this person no matter how hard I try to be good. The classic imposter syndrome. I will work hard. That is all I can do. I can always do better, but considering the circumstances, I think I'm doing well. I'm making headway in HTML/CSS, Git, and Github. I'm starting to feel some fluency with what I know. It feels good.</p>

          <p>Yes . . . at some point I will style this blog . . .</p>

          <h1>Moving Right Along</h1>
          <h3>September 7, 2018</h3>

          <p>I know I haven't posted in a while. I've still been working. Definitely not as much, but definitely working. I camped near Pacific City on the coast with a friend over the Memorial Day weekend. That slowed me down. Between trying to keep up with his lifestyle and breaking my routine, it has been rough getting back into a better flow.</p>

          <p>I'm going to go to another Epicodus open house (what they are calling a workshop) tomorrow. I plan on keeping more calm than I did last time. I want to engage and really work with my partner. I hope it can go both ways. Paired programming will be one of the first major hurdles for me, so I think it's a good idea that I'm spending my time trying to drill HTML/CSS basics.</p>

          <p>I got a webpage going with a "hero" image (not sure I like that name). After reading a few articles and tutorials I closed the books and built as much as I could from memory while using semantic HTML and creating my own class names and using the tools I already have like grid, which I think only one tutorial even vaguely touched on (then they seemed to switch to flex, so I'm not sure what was going on there or quite why. I solved the centering problems with my tools (and a bunch of trial and error). I did go back to articles and tutorials once I got to a certain point. I needed to troubleshoot some nav and ul issues, as well as some grid refreshing. I also used font-size with vw to make the page more rsponsive. That I found out by looking up responsive text. I need to understand linear-gradient better. I used the rgba () function because I've seen it in the wild and in tutorials, but it didn't occur to me that it would be a good idea for legibility until a tutorial mentioned it. Which brings up two ideas . . . learning by imitation and plagarism.</p>

          <p>Learning by imitation is how all learning begins. No matter what you study, first you copy what teachers or the people around you do, imitate them, then as you gain fluency, you begin to improvise and develop your own style. So what makes using code you didn't write plagarism? Is the difference whether you use it to actually understand what it is and alter it to suit your goals versus sticking it into your code without bothering to learn from it?</p>

          <p>I wonder if I should ask this question tomorrow . . .</p>

          <p>OK. Kick boxing at 7am. Goodnight.</p>

          <h1>C# Intro: Week Two</h1>
          <h3>Oct. 14, 2018</h3>

          <p><span>Think about asking for help in the classroom. Are there times when it's easier or harder for you to ask for assistance from a peer? What about a teacher?</span></p>

          <p>I haven't felt much urge or need to ask for a teacher's assistance with a code problem yet.</p>

          <p>I have a harder time asking for help from a peer because I feel like I'm exposing my inadequacies. Not understanding the material fast enough, being too needy.</p>

          <p><span>What factors make it harder to ask for help? Why do these stand in your way?</span></p>

          <p>The fact that we're in competition essentially; my fear of others' egos and my own sense of inadequecy (so, my ego). They don't stand in my way. I still ask for help if I feel like I've done what I can to work out the problem on my own.</p>

          <p><span>What can you do to minimize or eliminate these factors?</span></p>

          <p>The more generous I am in spirit, tone, and information to anyone who might ask me for help, the more likely that generosity is to spread through the cohort. That is the only control I have of the situation.</p>

          <p><span>In what ways could you practice sharing your problem solving process throughout the week?</span></p>

          <p>I'm not certain that I know or understand my own problem solving process yet. I know that I am not a verbal thinker and that can slow down communication because I have to translate mental images into words first.</p>

          <p>When I'm stuck I tend to just keep experimenting, reading external sources, experimenting, visualizing, drawing, and writing until I fix the issue or need to take a break.</p>

          <p>I think it might be good to start asking for more help from Lina and Franz. Not because I want the answers, but because I want to know what kinds of questions they ask themselves in problem solving.</p>

          <h1>C# Intro: Week Three</h1>
          <h3>Oct. 22, 2018</h3>

          <p><span>What is it about encountering a difficult task or bug that frustrates you? Do you have any behavior patterns that make solving these problems more difficult? (For example, do you always feel pressured to finish projects quickly, making time setbacks involved in bugs stressful or upsetting? Does being uncertain how to solve a bug evoke feelings of not being 'good' or 'smart' enough?, etc.) List as many as applicable.</span></p>

          <p>So far I enjoy bugs. They teach you things you more thoroughly than if things went right. You might not actually know why things went right, but if you fix a bug, you're far more likely to know what went wrong and how to make it right in the first pplace.</p>

          <p>I do stress about bugs when I'm feeling crunched for time. Or if I think my pair thinks I should be able to figure out the problem faster than I am able. In those situations I do feel the "not good/smart/fast enough" syndrome.</p>

          <p>I also get a little panicky when the console doesn't show any errors because it makes knowing where to start harder. I need to develop my skill in that area.</p>

          <p><span>Conversely, is there anything about tricky bugs or issues you actually enjoy? (It's okay if there isn't, but do you like hunting down the problem? The debugging process? The satisfaction of finally making it work?) Do you have any patterns of behavior that make solving problems easier or less stressful?</span></p>

          <p>I don't know that this actually makes bugs easier to fix, but just the fact that I enjoy trying to fix them must help. I also think that having experience in martial arts and yoga helps because I know that the best thing to do is to make sure you're breathing. It's easy to hold your breath without realising it. Then I check the console for error messages. Then I re-read the code, checking to see that I at least know what I expect it to do.</p>

          <p><span>Review the list of things you find frustrating. For each item, identify something you could try to lessen that frustration, and turn the situation into a productive educational experience. (For instance, if the time setback is what stresses you most about bugs, could you plan on reminding yourself that Epicodus doesn't grade students on the amount of work they finish each day?)</span></p>

          <p>I need to stop comparing myself to others, but our entire culture is set up for comparison, so yeah, there's that. I also need to trust that if I out in the time my outcomes will be good and will improve. No matter what problems I'm having in coding, as long as I work hard and keep working hard, I can trust that things will work themselves out.</p>

          <p><span>Review the list of things you actually find enjoyable about tracking down bugs, if anything. Is there anything you could do to maximize this benefit or enjoyment? List your ideas.</span></p>

          <p>I'd like to be able to help teach others how to love bugs and develop processes to solve them. I try to have an excite positive energy when my pair encounters them. They've been some of the best times in class so far. The funniest and most educational.</p>

          <h1>C# Intro: Week Four</h1>
          <h3>Oct. 29, 2018</h3>

          <p><span>When, like all developers, you encounter a problem you can't immediately solve, what's your internal reaction? Is it along the lines of "Oh, I'm not smart enough for this."? More like "Okay, I just need to learn more.", or something else?</span></p>

          <p>My reaction to problems seem to follow this sequence: first is a moment of panic, especially if time has gotten away from me and the deadline is threatening; next is an exhale, a submission to reality, a recentering and claming down; then a kind of internal laugh and a recognition that this is what it's all about. If you're not solving problems, then what are you doing? There are the problems (tasks) assigned for you to solve and there are the problems (bugs) that crop up while working on the first problem. Replacing turtles with problems, it's problems all the way down.</p>

          <p><span>Be honest, what do you value and praise yourself for more? Innately/already knowing how to solve a problem? Or being able to stick with it, research, troubleshoot, and learn more to debug?</span></p>

          <p>Culturally - I don't know if this is American, "Western", or just globally modern - the tendency is to look to people who innately see how to solve issues as the benchmark. And I feel low when I can't or if I'm working with someone who seems to be able to do this. But I am getting better at getting past this initial reaction and recognizing that while I may not be the smartest, fastest, savviest person, I am finding solutions and I once found I am able to refine them and recall how to solve those kinds of problems. I can stick to this and I know it's a skill of its own type.</p>

          <p><span>Based on your answers to questions above, do you think you have a growth mindset? Why or why not?</span></p>

          <p>I do have a growth mindset. Partly developed through beginning martial arts training two years ago, and honestly, refound and refocused thanks to the Epicodus curriculum.</p>

          <p><span>If you don't currently have a growth mindset, identify what you could do differently to begin fostering one. Or, if you already think you do, what could you to do maximize it?</span></p>

          <p>I still need to get over jealousy of people who are smarter and faster than I am. It's a hinderance. It can make me feel like quitting.</p>

          <h1>C# Week One</h1>
          <h3>Nov. 13, 2018</h3>

          <p><span>What were your most notable non-technical discoveries during this exercise? Whether about yourself, group communication, working with others, or something else?</span></p>

          <p>I learned that I would rather plan longer and communicate more with my team. I would rather spend a whole day planning and talking about the problem away from the computer. Not doing this hurt our ability to work well together. The overall goal was murky.</p>

          <p><span>What were your greatest strengths? What about your biggest areas for improvement?</span></p>

          <p>I think I am good at having an global view of where the team is and what is going on, and what needs to be done.</p>

          <p>I need to let people do what they are going to do. I get frustrated when I perceive that teammates are not really throwing themselves in. I feel the pressure of having a good outcome, I take on that responsibility, so I feel like if I don't take the lead and try to get people together no one will and I will take the blame if things come out less than good. I take on too much stress and responsibility.</p>

          <p><span>Identify what you can do in the next five weeks to further develop any areas for improvement before the next group project.</span></p>

          <p>I don't know. I guess other people would tell me to relax, but if I do it's my fault if the project isn't good.</p>

          <p><span>Overall, what would you do differently next time? Is there a lesson to be learned and brought with you to your pairing or next group week experience?</span></p>

          <p>I would insist on at least a half day of planning, if not a full day. Nowhere near a computer, other than phones so we can look up ideas cogent to the planning process.</p>

          <h1>C# Week Two</h1>
          <h3>Nov. 25, 2018</h3>

          <p><span>Jot down brief examples and stories of times you've demonstrated aptitude in the following areas.</span></p>

          <p><strong>Problem solving, both technical and not: </strong>With not much more than what was in the office file cabinets and the computer I learned how to write grants and operate the day-to-day business, as well as contribute to the yearly programming for a literary organization. I would talk to the executive director most days on the phone and I would ask her questions, but ultimately my digging through the paper and digital files are where I trained myself.</p>

          <p>At Kitchen Kaboodle there was an inefficient and dangerous way of storing unused shelving. I reorganized the shelving by making sure it was accessible without ladders, ordered by size, and maintainable.</p>

          <p><strong>Time management, especially when under multiple deadlines: </strong>Grant-writing at Mountain Writers' Series; Keeping up with advertising and customer service while at One Green World</p>

          <p><strong>Team collaboration and communication: </strong>Working with individuals and institutions to make writers' tours and events happen throughout the Pacific Northwest.</p>

          <p><strong>Leadership: </strong></p>

          <p><strong>Fostering and contributing toward an inclusive, productive environment: </strong></p>

          <p><strong>Setting and meeting goals: </strong>In my third year at Mountain Writers' Series, I made a goal of my predecessor come to fruition. He had wanted to have the Chinese poet Bei Dao do a tour with MWS. I made the connections to him at UC Davis, coordinated events and funding with educational and cultural partners along the West Coast, included his tour with the other programs of MWS and wrote two successful grants: one to the National Endowment to the Arts and the other to the Regional Arts and Culture Council.</p>

          <p><strong>Tackling tough problems or tasks, learning and researching as you go: </strong>Teaching myself HTML/CSS so that I could update the Mountain Writers' Series website.</p>

          <p><span>Along these same lines, think about other jobs and work you've done. How do they relate to the coding work you've done here at Epicodus, even if they're non-technical in nature?</span></p>

          <p>The problem is that I do not recall any particular stories about these kinds of things. Yes, I took over the Program Associate position at Mountain Writers' Series with no training or even onsite support. Yes, I became the defacto office manager of One Green World. But the thing that made that happen wasn't anything but perseverence. I show up every day. I figure out what I need to do and by when, then I do it. There are no particular stories about it. I just showed up and worked. If anything perseverence seems to be the key to indispensibility.</p>

          <p>I feel like I need help figuring this out in terms of making a case for myself as a good person to hire and work with.</p>

          <h1>JavaScript Week One</h1>
          <h3>Jan. 7, 2019</h3>

          <p><span>Looking back on your experience in the previous two courses, what do you think helped you learn tough new concepts the most? (Taking notes while completing homework? Making sure to talk through everything verbally with your partner? Something else?) Jot down anything that comes to mind.</span></p>

          <p>Physical repetition seems to be the only thing that helps me learn. I do not think we get enough repetition at Epicodus. Or maybe we repeat the wrong things? I feel weak in problem solving, specifically those kinds of problems that we will be presented in technical and whiteboarding interviews. We seem to spend a lot of time doing rote set up of environments or stacks or whatever they're called, but very little time learning how to do testing and get a working solution. Unless I am doing the same thing every day, all day, I don't seem to learn well.</p>

          <p>Maybe the problem is that I don't feel like I'm learning how to do this stuff. Maybe I'm just too tense to learn.</p>

          <p><span>Similarly, think back to your most successful pairing experiences. What common traits did they share? (Did you make sure to check periodically to ensure neither partner felt overwhelmed? Talk through everything before making decisions?) Record anything that comes to mind.</span></p>

          <p>The best pairings I've had tend to be with people who are patient, not concerned with speed, or being right. I would rather find out the wrong way to do something with someone than be told what the correct way to do something is by someone. Things work best for me when both people are a part of the process and understand where we are and where we are going. I will abandon a solution I think is doable if my partner doesn't understand it and I can't explain what I'm thinking. It's better at that point to start over.</p>

          <p><span>Determine how you can intentionally apply the beneficial tactics and approaches you identified above to this next course. Both in your own learning, and in your pairing experiences. Write down at least three things you can do to maximize your time in JavaScript both for your own learning, and with your partners. Format these as goals, if possible (For example, "I will take notes on every night's homework, even if they're brief", or "I will make a conscious effort to break down concepts by talking through them, since I know that helps me learn best", etc.)</span></p>

          <p>I think my first goal should be to relax. My second goal should be to expand my ability to explain what I don't understand. My third goal should be to understand how to go from getting a stack set up to solving a problem more quickly.</p>

          <h1>JavaScript Week Two</h1>
          <h3>Jan. 14, 2019</h3>

          <p><span>What are your top three strengths you think will apply to your future career? These don't have to be coding-related, but certainly can be.</span></p>

          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>Reliability</li>
              <li>Consistency</li>
              <li>Honesty</li>
            </ol>
          </p>

          <p>My reliability at previous jobs is not something you would see 'in action.' But it is reflected in that my co-workers and supervisors knew that I would be at work and ready to do my best every day. They didn't have to worry about whether I would show up or be helpful. They could concentrate on doing what they needed to get done.</p>

          <p>My consistency is related to my reliability. I make an effort to do things in a reliably consistent manner. I make things organized, clean up after myself, and try to think ahead to what will make things easier for the next person. I also feel like I'm not to rigid about this.</p>

          <p>I feel that I am honest with myself and others. I am not self-aggrandizing. I admit mistakes and take responsibility for them. I will choose someone else's solution to a problem over my own if it seems like a better idea or will ultimately make things easier or faster. I will incorporate other peoples' tendencies into systems I create so that the systems are more maintainable with less effort.</p>

          <p><span>What are your current areas of weakness? List at least three. Remain gentle, yet reasonable and honest with yourself. This isn't a time for negative self-talk, but a time to objectively identify areas for growth.</span></p>

          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>Unwilling to step on people's toes</li>
              <li>Slow to solve problems</li>
              <li>Tend to be confused</li>
            </ol>
          </p>

          <p>I think in some ways my weaknesses are related to my stregnths. They are focused on my perception of other people. There are aspects of each that are related and intertwined. I can have a hard time making decisions because I don't want to hurt someone else's feelings, which slows down my ability to problem solve and act. It also adds a lot of information to the storm in my head which can add to my general confusion.</p>

          <p>I should try to get better about opening up dialog with people so that I avoid stepping on their toes and continue the process of solving problems and getting work done. I tend to clam up when I sense that other people are frustrated or angry or upset because I don't know what to do or say and I feel responsible for their emotional states.</p>

          <p>Speeding up my ability to problem solve would be a two-headed endeavor. I need to get better at leaving others' emotional states to them and just do what I need to do. Keeping dialog open would help with this, I think.</p>

          <p>Adjacent to this is just finding time to work on solving problems, puzzles, etc. would give me more experience and a wider range of tools, and more experience using those tools.</p>

          <p>My confusion is partly physical, partly mental, and partly social and these parts are bound up together. To deal with the physical I try to eat well and get lots of exercise, but that's about all I can do with that. The mental portion would be helped with taking the time to work on general problem solving as mentioned above. The social element is especially difficult. I have a hard time being in my own head because I'm so affected by other people's body language and my perception of their emotional state.</p>
