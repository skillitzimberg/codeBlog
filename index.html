          <h1>The Blog Begins</h1>
          <h3>August 21, 2018</h3>

          <div class="content">
            <p>I'm as shy of words as I am of cameras. They are both unflattering and it's glaringly obvious how pained I am to seem at ease, cool, smart, or even just pretty alright. Instead you can see the crazy swirling around behind shifty eyes. At least that's what I see, so yeah, I keep away from the pointy side of the lens and a wagging tongue.</p>

            <p>And here I go starting a blog. Why? Because I'm finally taking action and choosing a path, a path I've considered before in less concrete ways, and could never get much traction in. I'm going to do my damnedest to become a professional web developer.</p>

            <p>The decision has been forced due to issues that make physical labor no longer sustainable for me. I'll be in pain for the rest of my life regardless of my profession, but there's no reason for me to aggravate the problem with the work I do. I need to save my physical efforts for healthy things like working out and training in martial arts - things that make me feel good despite the pain.</p>

            <p>So where am I on this path? To me it seems like maybe a mile in at this point. And honestly I've covered this mile a couple of times over the years, but never quite the same way and the field has changed a lot over the years I've watched it. I'm relearning HTML/CSS right now. I've had some experience with JavaScript and even less with Ruby before, but I'm concentrating on the fundamentals and trying to get that really fluid.</p>

            <p>I'm using the <a href="https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/intro-to-programming-online">Epicodus curriculum</a> and Colt Steele's "The Web Developer Bootcamp" course on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp">Udemy</a>. I blew through the first two weeks of the Epicodus material in about ten hours. Then I hit the assignment which is meant to teach Git branching and merging, as well as reinforce the basic HTML/CSS the course has covered to that point. The assignment was to create a multi-page website with at least two different styles/themes (hello, branching) for a "client" who operates a resort. When the client chose one of the versions, we're supposed to merge the chosen branch into the master.</p>

            <p>I was kind of stumped by the creative side of the assignment. I know enough to be a danger to myself and a website full of barely styled lists and random photos scattered throughout just didn't appeal to me. I wanted to make something at least marginally slicker than that. The problem is that besides needing to refresh on the material I'd learned previously, I have a kind of creative block on web design. There are so many ways a site can be layed out! What do I choose? How does my choice affect how I structure the HTML? How do I write HTML that CSS can style any way I want without editing it to work for the new styles? And how do I choose colors that aren't drab or garish, that have some kind of relationship to the project itself? Where do I get all these photos without spending hours just copying and pasting urls and file names? Aaaagggghhh!</p>

            <p>OK. Calm down, kid. How to tackle this reasonably? Through Mr. Steele's bootcamp I knew that Bootstrap Grid was a thing and made lay out way way more simple than it was when I first encountered this stuff in 2000. Then I found out that CSS has a native grid (presumably this is what Bootstrap exploits and embellishes, but I don't know that for a fact yet). I decided to first learn layout by building a photo gallery project using nothing but the old CSS float methods; then I recreated the same thing using CSS grids; next I'll tackle Bootstrap grid. But I wound up getting antsy about the resort project, so I ended up building it using vanilla CSS. (Is that a thing? Sometimes it's better to speculate - why let Google ruin everything with "facts?") Anyway, here we are almost two weeks later and I've nearly got the basic resort website done. From there I can start branching and seeing what I can do to make variations with what I've learned so far.</p>

            <p>I feel a bit ashamed that it's taken me this long to get this far with the resort project, but I did make some deep detours, learned a ton, and made it relevant to the assignment at a level way above what the assignment was really looking for in terms of HTML/CSS. I've a got a better toolbox and a better understanding of how to use those tools. There is still a lot of refinement to be done, of course, but I've definitely done something.</p>

            <p>From what I've been reading about the process of becoming a web developer, I'm going to have to bare myself a bit and push the things I've done so far to Github, even though they're silly, simple, and nothing more than me futzing around trying to see how some things worked (or didn't). I guess I'll lay it all out there and see what happens. At least it's the truth and might give someone a laugh.</p>

          <h1>Clunk, Clank, Thud</h1>
          <h3>August 22, 2018</h3>

          <p>Today I finished the first version of the resort website project. Next up is branching it and working on a new version. I did make a gh-pages branch, but I couldn't get Git to push it via the terminal. I ended up creating a branch on Github. The whole push thing has proven to be fuzzy for me. I can't tell yet where it's getting the user name or why it seems to change on me. Sometimes it's "sb" which I set for one of the early projects. For this blog it seems to be "-u" (???) which I need to look up. I'll hazard a guess that it means something along the lines of "get the current username." I'm going to go back to the beginning of the Epicodus course and review. I'm having the same trouble branching and getting this blog on gh-pages. I will solve this.</p>

          <h1>Git It!</h1>
          <h3>August 23, 2018</h3>

          <p>I'm still working on making sure that I understand Git and the process for creating a local repository, a remote repository, branching, merging, and gh-pages. I failed at this with my original blog repository and it all got too confused, so I have deleted that repository on Github and started a new local repository called codeBlog. It's exactly the same; only the name has changed.</p>

          <p>So here are the steps as I understand them (I'm using the terminal here, just in case you don't already know that, and I'm only showing the basic form of the commands for brevity and because this is really for my own understanding at this point.):
            <ol>
              <li><strong>[$ mkdir and $ touch]</strong>: create a local directory and any files you want in it;</li>
              <li><strong>[$ cd]</strong>: navigate into the directory;</li>
              <li><strong>[$ git init]</strong>: initialize the repository;</li>
              <li><strong>[$ git status]</strong>: optional command to verify that Git is tracking the repository and check on the state of the repository;</li>
              <li><strong>[$ git add]</strong>: stage one or more files or even the entire repository for committing;</li>
              <li><strong>[$ git status]</strong>: verify what has been staged for committing;</li>
              <li><strong>[$ git commit]</strong>: commit the current state of the repository. The message appended to this commit needs to be in present tense and complete the sentence, "This commit will . . .";</li>

              <li><strong>[$ git log]</strong>: to see the Git history and verify that this commit went as planned;</li>
              <p>Go to Github and create a remote repository with the exact same name as the local repository. Use the URL Github gives you in the next step.</p>
              <li><strong>[$ git remote add (nickname or initals) (Github URL to the remote repository)]</strong>: direct Git to the Github repository to which to push the local repository;</li>
              <li><strong>[$ git remote -v]: </strong>: verify that this worked as planned;</li>
              <li><strong>[$ git push (nickname or initals) master]: </strong>: push the local repository to the remote (Github) repository;</li>
              <li><strong>[$ git branch (branch name)]: </strong>: create a branch repository from the master repository;</li>
              <li><strong>[$ git checkout (branch name)]: </strong>: "navigate" to the branch - any changes will be made to the branch leaving the master as it is;</li>
              <li><strong>[$ git push (nickname or initals) (branch name)]: </strong>: push this branch of the local repository to its "twin" remote (Github) repository;</li>

            </ol>
          </p>

          <p> This is as far as I have gotten, and it's a really good thing I listed out the step like this. To do this I combed back through the Epicodus curriculum to make sure I had the steps and commands right. I realized in the process that past a certain point I was following steps that were meant for dealing with a repository that has been cloned from Github. The basics are the same, but "origin" is used instead of a nickname or initals because "origin" is the nickname Git automatically gives to cloned repositories.</p>

          <p>I'll follow these steps for codeBlog and see how it pans out . . .</p>

          <p>And . . . it works! Well of course it does, if you do it right. That was a really good idea, listing out these steps: codeBlog is now hosted <a href="https://skillitzimberg.github.io/codeBlog/">here</a>.</p>

          <p>Next on my coding plate is to look into the semantic HTML elements and refactor some previous work to see how it is affected and what kinds of changes I'll need to make to the CSS. It seems like it would be easier in some ways. It could potentially make selecting much more specific and cut down some on classes and ID's.</p>

          <h1>Epicodus Journal Post One</h1>
          <h3>August 25, 2018</h3>

          <p><em>Why did you make the decision to enroll in a coding bootcamp? What are you aiming to achieve by completing 27 weeks of technical training?</em></p>
          <p>I got a job out of college in which one of my responsibilities was maintaining the website. I had never encountered HTML and CSS before. I learned how to do it by using "view source," CSSZengarden, and dissecting the code in order to see how it worked. I literally printed many pages of html and made diagrams to learn it. I gained some fluency and eventually redesigned the website from scratch. But between working, playing music, and relationships I could never devote myself to it. In late 2014 I enrolled in courses at Portland Community College to pursue a career in IT. One of the courses I took was an introduction to programming that used JavaScript. I really liked it and seemed to have an aptitude for it. I could easily spend 8 to 10 hours straight working on it. It absorbed me. Unfortunately, my relationship dissolved (not because of coding) and I had to make changes that did not allow me the time for school. Due to lifelong physical challenges, I've finally gotten to a place where I cannot sustain physical labor anymore and I am not willing to just take on any dead-end desk job. I need to take the plunge, risk it all. I've got nothing to lose and everything to gain.</p>

          <p><em>Do you already have specific goals for yourself in mind? If not, can you think of any now?</em></p>

          <p>My goal is to become a freelance web/app developer. I have that as my five year goal, but will do whatever I can to make it happen sooner. But honestly, just making a living coding, even at the financial level I have been working in warehouses and factories would be a major success. Ideally I'd like to work for small to medium size companies as I really appreciate that scale of business. There's something particulary intriguing to me about that level. Probably because I've tended to work for that size company and like how everyone knows everyone, processes are more fluid, and work is an "all hands on deck" affair - everyone can or does do everything, there are no real specialists.</p>

          <h1>Constipation</h1>
          <h3>August 27, 2018</h3>

          <p>I'm really having trouble with this resort website assignment. Not so much in just putting together a webpage, but in maybe trying to make it too complicated? Or just over thinking it? I don't know why. I know what kind of websites I would like to learn how to mimic just to be able to do it, but there's no need to do that with this assignment. On top of that mind game, I don't know where to start with images. They are unruly things. I'm not sure how to get them to the size I want without stretching out of proportion or only showing the top portion of them. There's got to be some set of tricks that tutorials just don't cover. Or I'm again over thinking what the tutorials are showing and missing some simple combination of attributes that would solve the issues I'm creating.</p>

          <p>I just need to make five webpages, put some photos and colors in them, then change the layout and color scheme a couple of times, but I can't seem to get past the idea of doing something grand. Really unhelpful and it's totally holding me back.</p>

          <p>OK. So the solution is to do what I said in the previous paragraph. Just let it be simple, even dumb. Just get it done. Done is better than stuck, even if the product isn't what you'd hoped for or tried to accomplish. Done is a better starting place.</p>

          <p>On a positive note, I am beginning to use semantic elements and they really do seem to make the html easier to read and selecting in css is far easier. Also, css grid makes doing wireframes pretty easy. So I have made progress there. I just have to get over this mental block on "creativity."</p>

          <h1>Sunset</h1>
          <h3>August 29, 2018</h3>

          <p>My life is about to change very dramatically. The if's are becoming when's and how's. But enough of that. We'll all be sick of hearing about it before long, so why start commenting on it now?</p>

          <p>It is 8:13PM, sunset in Portland, Oregon. I feel like I've had a bit of a success with coding today. Well, maybe over the last two days. I now have two branches of the resort project, master and sunset. Each is a complete, though very simple, website. I only changed one HTML element between them (an H1 to an H2) in the sunset branch. They look very different. Sunset is more along the lines of what I've been trying to accomplish and I created it by changing the CSS almost entirely without looking at the HTML. Past a certain pooint of course I checked in on the HTML and looked at it in the browser, but only once I knew in my mind pretty much how it was going to look. And I was pretty close to right. That felt like a victory.</p>

          <p>I stumbled across a developer named <a href="https://neilonsoftware.com/">Neil Green</a> today. He has a very interesting take on coding. It's more about philosophy and personality types in the world of working developers. As a person who has a fairly negative view of himself, I looked at his desciption of a developer type called The Incompetent. This is my worst case scenario. I fear I could very well be this person no matter how hard I try to be good. The classic imposter syndrome. I will work hard. That is all I can do. I can always do better, but considering the circumstances, I think I'm doing well. I'm making headway in HTML/CSS, Git, and Github. I'm starting to feel some fluency with what I know. It feels good.</p>

          <p>Yes . . . at some point I will style this blog . . .</p>

          <h1>Moving Right Along</h1>
          <h3>September 7, 2018</h3>

          <p>I know I haven't posted in a while. I've still been working. Definitely not as much, but definitely working. I camped near Pacific City on the coast with a friend over the Memorial Day weekend. That slowed me down. Between trying to keep up with his lifestyle and breaking my routine, it has been rough getting back into a better flow.</p>

          <p>I'm going to go to another Epicodus open house (what they are calling a workshop) tomorrow. I plan on keeping more calm than I did last time. I want to engage and really work with my partner. I hope it can go both ways. Paired programming will be one of the first major hurdles for me, so I think it's a good idea that I'm spending my time trying to drill HTML/CSS basics.</p>

          <p>I got a webpage going with a "hero" image (not sure I like that name). After reading a few articles and tutorials I closed the books and built as much as I could from memory while using semantic HTML and creating my own class names and using the tools I already have like grid, which I think only one tutorial even vaguely touched on (then they seemed to switch to flex, so I'm not sure what was going on there or quite why. I solved the centering problems with my tools (and a bunch of trial and error). I did go back to articles and tutorials once I got to a certain point. I needed to troubleshoot some nav and ul issues, as well as some grid refreshing. I also used font-size with vw to make the page more rsponsive. That I found out by looking up responsive text. I need to understand linear-gradient better. I used the rgba () function because I've seen it in the wild and in tutorials, but it didn't occur to me that it would be a good idea for legibility until a tutorial mentioned it. Which brings up two ideas . . . learning by imitation and plagarism.</p>

          <p>Learning by imitation is how all learning begins. No matter what you study, first you copy what teachers or the people around you do, imitate them, then as you gain fluency, you begin to improvise and develop your own style. So what makes using code you didn't write plagarism? Is the difference whether you use it to actually understand what it is and alter it to suit your goals versus sticking it into your code without bothering to learn from it?</p>

          <p>I wonder if I should ask this question tomorrow . . .</p>

          <p>OK. Kick boxing at 7am. Goodnight.</p>
